Virtualization
===================


The disadvantage of this approach is these application running on the
guest OS have to pass through n number of lavers to access the H/W
resources.

Containarization
======================
Here we have bare metal on top of whcih we install the host Os
and on the hsot OS we install an application called as Docker Engine
On the docker engine we can run any application in the form of containers
Docker is a technology for creating thse containers

Docker achive what is commonly called as "process isolation"
ie all the applications(processes) have some dependency on a specific
OS.This dependency is removed by docker and we can run them on any
OS as containers if we have Docker engine installed

These containers pass through less no of layers to access the h/w resources
also organizations need not spend money on purchasing licenses of different
OS's to maintian various applications

Docker can be used at the the stages of S/W development life cycle
Build---->Ship--->Run



===========================================================================
Docker comes in 2 flavours
Docker CE (Community Edition)
Docker EE (Enterprise Edition)
