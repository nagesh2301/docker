Till now docker is for handling developer and testing environment.

To handle production environment we have container orchestration.


Features of container orchestration:

Load balancing
Scaling up and Scaling down
Rolling update
High availability


Container orchestration is handled by:

Docker swarm
kubernates
AWS - ECS
IBM - openshell
Apache - mesos

Docker swarm and kubernates only in our syllabus
