Day-15:


note: check class notes as well


To remove a worker from swarm cluster
docker node update --availability drain Worker1

To make this worker rejoin the swarm
docker node update --availability active Worker1

To make worker2 leave the swarm
Connect to worker2 usig git bash
docker swarm leave

To make manager leave the swarm
docker swarm leave --force

To generate the tokenid for a machine to join swarm as worker
docker swarm join-token worker

To generate the tokenid for a machine to join swarm as manager
docker swarm join-token manager

To promote Worker1 as a manager
docker node promote Worker1

To demote "Worker1" back to a worker status
docker node demote Worker1



=============================================================================
FailOver Scenarios of Workers
================================
Create httpd with 6 replicas and delete one replica running on the manager
Check if all 6 replicas are still running

Drain Worker1 from the docker swarm and check if all 6 replicas are running
on Manager and Worker2,make Worker1 rejoin the swarm

Make Worker2 leave the swarm and check if all the 6 replicas are
running on Manager and Worker1

1 Create httpd with 6 replicas
  docker service create  --name webserver -p 9090:80 --replicas 6 httpd

2 Check the replicas running on Manager
  docker service ps webserver | grep Manager

3 Check the container id
  docker container ls

4 Delete a replica
  docker rm -f container_id_from_step3

5 Check if all 6 replicas are running
  docker service ps webserver

6 Drain Worker1 from the swarm
  docker node update --availability drain Worker1

7 Check if all 6 replicas are still running on Manager and Worker2
  docker service ps webserver

8 Make Worker1 rejoin the swarm
  docker node update --availability active Worker1

9 Make Worker2 leave the swarm
  Connect to Worker2 using git bash
  docker swarm leave
  Connect to Manager
  
10 Check if all 6 replicas are still running
   docker service ps webserver


======================================================================
FailOver Scenarios of Managers
====================================
If a worker instance crashses all the replicas running on that
worker will be moved to the Manager or the other workers.
If the Manager itself crashes the swarm becomes headless 
ie we cannot perfrom container orchestration activites in this
swamr cluster

To avoid this we should maintain multiple managers
Manager nodes have the status as Leader or Reachable

If one manager node goes down other manager becomes the Leader
Quorum is resonsible for doing this activity and if uses a RAFT
algorithm for handling the failovers of managers.Quorum also 
is responsible for mainting the min number of manager

Min count of manager required for docker swarm should be always
more than half of the total count of Managers

Total Manager Count  -    Min Manager Required - Fault Tolerance
      1              -           1             -    0
      2              -           2             -    0
      3              -           2             -    1
      4              -           3             -    1
      5              -           3             -    2
      6              -           4             -    2
      7              -           4             -    3
      8              -           5             -    3
