Day-7:

docker volume container: It is bidirectional means data created host server will be available in container and
data created in container available in host server even after container is deleted.  if the file is deleted in
one container or in host server it will reflect in all the containers and host server.

sudo su -

docker volume create myvolume

docker volume inspect myvolume

copy mountpoint: /var/lib/docker/volumes/myvolume/_data

cd /var/lib/docker/volumes/myvolume/_data

touch f1 f2

docker run --name u1 -it -v myvolume:/tmp ubuntu
		-- we want to access the volume created in host machine in u1 container in /tmp path
		
cd /tmp

ls  -- f1 and f2 files  are visible here

touch f3 f4

exit from container

docker rm -f 

cd /var/lib/docker/volumes/myvolume/_data

ls  -- files created in host and container all files are visible even after deletion  of container


---

usecase: if we want a file to be available for container we can use the below usecase means the  file will be
available from host server to container.

docker run --name t1 -d 9090:8080 tomee

docker volume create newvolume
 
/var/lib/docker/volumes/newvolume/_data

cd /var/lib/docker/volumes/newvolume/_data

vim tomcat-user.xml
<tomcat>
        <users username="nagesh" password="boddupally"/>
        fjldsgsldgjldsfjdl
</tomcat>

docker run --name t2 -d -p 8888:8080 -v newvolume:/tmp tomee

docker exec -it t2 bash
 
cd /tmp

cat tomcat-user.xml
<tomcat>
        <users username="nagesh" password="boddupally"/>
        fjldsgsldgjldsfjdl
</tomcat>


docker volume prune -f   -- for deleting volumes
-----

create images:

docker run --name u1 -it ubuntu

apt-get update

apt-get install git

apt-get install maven

ctrl+p, ctrl+q

docker rm -f u1 -- deleted container means all intalled softwares also gets deleted

docker run --name u1 -it ubuntu  -- even after creating container with same name as previous container where 
									software are installed then wont reflect in presently created container
		
apt-get update

apt-get install git

apt-get install maven

ctrl+p, ctrl+q
		
docker commit u1 myubuntu

docker images  -- myubuntu image will reflect here

				-- if we check  in this container which is created with myubuntu images git and maven are already
				installed in this  container. We can create many container  as our wish with this image
				


=============================================================================
Dockerfile
===================
Dockerfile uses predefined keyword to create customsied
docker images.

Important keyword in dockerfile
===================================
FROM : This is used to specify the base image from where a
customised docker image has to be created

MAINTAINER : This represents the name of the organization or the
author that has created this dockerfile

RUN :Used to run linux commands in the container
     Generally it used to do s/w installtion or
     running scripts

USER : This is used to specify who should be the default user
       to login into the container

COPY : Used to copy files from host to the customised image that
       we are creating

ADD : This is similar to copy where it can copy files from host
      to image but ADD can also downlaod files from some remote server

EXPOSE : USed to specify what port should be used by the container

VOLUME : Used for automatic volume mounting ie we will have a volume
         mounted automatically when the container start

WORKDIR : Used to specify the default working directory of the container



ENV : This is used to specify what environment varibles should
     be used

CMD : USed to run the default process of the container from outside
      
ENTRYPOINT : This is also used to run the default process of the container
             
LABEL: Used to store data about the docker image in key value pairs

SHELL : Used to specify what shell should be by default used by the image

===========

UseCase
===========
Create a dockerfile to use nginx as abse image and specify
the maintainer as intelliqit

1 Create docker file
vim dockerfile

FROM nginx
MAINTAINER intelliqit

2 To create an image from this file
  docker build -t mynginx .

3 Check if the image is created or not
  docker images
