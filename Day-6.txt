Day 6
==========================================================================
UseCase
==============
Create a docker compose file to setup the LAMP architecture
vim lamp.yml
---
version: '3.8'

services:
 mydb:
  image: mysql
  environment:
   MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: intelliqit

 apache:
  image: httpd
  ports:
   - 8989:80
  links:
   - mydb:mysql

 php:
  image: php:7.2-apache
  links:
   - mydb:mysql
   - apache:httpd
...

To create containers from the above file
docker-compose -f lamp.yml up -d

To delete the containers
docker-compose -f lamp.yml down


========================================================================
UseCase
============
Create a docker compose file to setup the selenium testing
environment where a selenium hub container is linked with
2 node containers one with chrome and other with firefox

vim docker-compose.yml
---
version: '3.8'

services:
 hub:
  image: selenium/hub
  ports:
   - 4444:4444
  container_name: hub

 chrome:
  image: selenium/node-chrome-debug
  ports:
   - 5901:5900
  links:
   - hub:selenium
  container_name: chrome

 firefox:
  image: selenium/node-firefox-debug
  ports:
   - 5902:5900
  links:
   - hub:selenium
  container_name: firefox
...

To setup the above architecture
docker-compose up -d

To check the running containers
docker container ls

To delete the containers
docker-compose down


============================================================================
Docker Volumes
====================
Containers are ephemeral(temporary) but the data processed by the
containers should be persistent.Once a container is delete all the 
data of the container is lost
To preserve the data even if the container is deleted we can use volumes

Volumes are classified into 3 types
======================================
1 Simple docker volume
2 Sharable dokcer volumes
3 Docker volume containers

Simple Docker volumes
===========================
These voluems are used only for preserving the data on the host
machine even if the containers is deleted

UsedCase
============
Create a directory /data and mount it as a volume on an ubuntu container
Create some files in the mounted volumes and check if the files
are preserved on the host machine even after the container is deleted

1 Create /data directory
  mkdir /data

2 Create an ubuntu container and mount the above directory as volume
  docker run --name u1 -it -v /data ubuntu
  In the container u1 go into /data directory and create some files
  cd /data
  touch file1 file2 file3
  exit

3 Identify the locatiuon where the mounted data is preserved
  docker inspect u1
  Search for "Mounts" section and copy the "Source" path

4 Delete the container
  docker rm -f u1

5 Check if the data is still present
  cd "source_path_from_step3"
  ls
======================================================================
Sharable Docker volumes
============================
These volumes are sharabale between multiple containers

Create 3 centos containers c1,c2,c3.
Mount /data as a volume on c1 container ,c2 should use the volume
used by c1 and c3 should use the volume used by c2

1 Create a centos container c1 and mount /data 
  docker run --name c2 -it -v /data centos

2 Go into the data folder create files in data folder
  cd data
  touch f1 f2

3  Come out of the container without exit
   ctlr+p,ctlr+q

4 Create another centos container c2 and it should used the voluems used by c1
  docker run --name c2 -it --volumes-from c1 centos
  
5 In the c2 container go into data folder and create some file
  cd data
  touch f3 f4

6 Come out of the container without exit
   ctlr+p,ctlr+q

7 Create another centos container c3 and it should use the volume used by c2
  docker run --name c3 -it --volumes-from c2 centos

8 In the c3 container go into data folder and create some file
  cd data
  touch f5 f6

9 Come out of the container without exit
   ctlr+p,ctlr+q

10 Go into any of the 3 contianers and we will see all the files
   docker attach c1
   cd /data
  ls
  exit

12 Identify the location the where the mounted data is stored
   docker inspect c1
   Search for "Mounts" section and copy the "Source" path

13 Delete all containers
   docker rm -f c1 c2 c3

14 Check if the files are still present
   cd "source_path_from"step12"
